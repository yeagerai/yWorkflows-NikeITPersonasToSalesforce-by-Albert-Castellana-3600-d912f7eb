# LinkedInProfilesScraper

## Component Name
LinkedInProfilesScraper

## Description
This component is designed to scrape LinkedIn profile URLs based on the given company and department input parameters. It uses the `transform()` method to process the input arguments and returns a list of URLs corresponding to LinkedIn profiles associated with the provided company and department.

## Input and Output Models
- **Input Model:** `LinkedInProfilesScraperInputDict` is a Pydantic BaseModel that accepts the arguments:
  - `company`: str - The target company name.
  - `department`: str - The target department within the company.
- **Output Model:** `LinkedInProfilesScraperOutputDict` is a Pydantic BaseModel that returns the output data:
  - `profile_urls`: List[str] - A list of LinkedIn profile URLs.

## Parameters
- `company` (str): The target company name.
- `department` (str): The target department within the company.

## Transform Function
The `transform()` method processes the input data in the following manner:
1. Extracts the `company` and `department` values from the input argument.
2. Queries the LinkedIn API for profile data matching the input company and department by calling `linkedin_api.get_profiles(company, department)`. (_Note: Replace 'linkedin_api' with the actual API requirement, such as 'linkedin_scraper'_)
3. Filters the query results, keeping only those profiles where the 'company' and 'department' fields match the input values.
4. Appends the filtered profile URL to a list named `profile_urls`.
5. Returns the `LinkedInProfilesScraperOutputDict` with `profile_urls` holding the list of profile URLs.

## External Dependencies
- **`os`, `dotenv`**: Used to load environment variables.
- **`yaml`**: Used for processing YAML formatted data.
- **`FastAPI`**: Used to create a FastAPI instance.
- **`Pydantic`**: Used to create input and output models, enforcing data validation and serialization.

## API Calls
- **LinkedIn API:** This component calls an external LinkedIn API (in this example, `linkedin_api`) to fetch and filter LinkedIn profiles based on the input company and department. Replace 'linkedin_api' with the actual API requirement, such as 'linkedin_scraper'.

## Error Handling
The error handling in this component is managed by Pydantic BaseModel, which validates input data types, ensuring that only valid data is processed. Additionally, the FastAPI instance handles any errors raised during the execution of API calls, returning appropriate error responses.
