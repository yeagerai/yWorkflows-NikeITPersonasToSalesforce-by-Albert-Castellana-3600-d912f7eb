NikeITPersonasToSalesforce

# Description
This component is designed to fetch a list of Nike IT Department personas, extract their name and email address, and store the information in a structured format. The component is part of a Yeager Workflow and is responsible for processing and transforming data between NikeIT personas and Salesforce systems.

# Input and Output Models
The component includes two Pydantic BaseModel classes for input and output validation and serialization.

## Input Model: NikeITPersonasToSalesforceIn
An empty input model class that inherits from BaseModel.

## Output Model: NikeITPersonasToSalesforceOut

1. Fetch the list of Nike IT Department personas by calling the `fetch_nike_it_personas(callbacks)` method.
2. Iterate through the fetched personas list and extract the name and email address by calling the `extract_name_and_email(persona)` method.
3. Append the extracted name and email in a dictionary-style format to the `personas_data` list.
4. Create an instance of the output model class `NikeITPersonasToSalesforceOut` with the populated `personas_data` list.
5. Return the output model instance.
